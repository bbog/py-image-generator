## Instructions
Open a terminal window and navigate to the location of the `generate.py` file. Then run `python generate.py`

By changing the values inside the `config.json` file, you can specify the number of generated images as well as their size, color and "watermark". The config offers support for random sizes and colors, and also ratio preserving for the images.
